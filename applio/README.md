> [!NOTE]  
> Applio will no longer receive frequent updates. Going forward, development will focus mainly on security patches, dependency updates, and occasional feature improvements. This is because the project is already stable and mature with limited room for further improvements. Pull requests are still welcome and will be reviewed.

## Introduction

Applio is a powerful voice conversion tool focused on simplicity, quality, and performance. Whether you're an artist, developer, or researcher, Applio offers a straightforward platform for high-quality voice transformations. Its flexible design allows for customization through plugins and configurations, catering to a wide range of projects.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Run the installation script based on your operating system:

- **Windows:** Double-click `run-install.bat`.
- **Linux/macOS:** Execute `run-install.sh`.

### 2. FastAPI Server (no GUI)

Applio now exposes only the essential training and inference capabilities over FastAPI.

```bash
pip install -r rvc/requirements.txt
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
python -m app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Available endpoints:

- `GET /` – Health check + default configuration preview
- `POST /train` – Launch preprocessing → feature extraction → training with default hyper-parameters
- `POST /inference` – Run voice conversion using an existing `.pth` (and optional `.index`) file

### 3. Static HTML Console

A lightweight HTML/JS client is bundled for quick manual testing.

- Open `http://localhost:8000/ui` in a browser.
- The page calls `/train` and `/inference` via Fetch API and renders the JSON responses in-place.

Example inference request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/inference \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "input_audio_path": "test/input.wav",
        "model_path": "logs/my_model/G_20000.pth",
        "index_path": "logs/my_model/added_IVF.index"
      }'
```

### 4. Optional: TensorBoard Monitoring

To monitor training or visualize data:

- **Windows:** Run `run-tensorboard.bat`.
- **Linux/macOS:** Run `run-tensorboard.sh`.
